# Right-On-Time
This is a schedule planner. 
This planner will display time slots from 9a - 5p and allow the user to input information and click the save button which stores that information within the computer. Depending on the time of day the colors of the box will change i.e if it is grey that means the time has passed, if it is red that means it is the current time and if the color is green that is a future time slot.
